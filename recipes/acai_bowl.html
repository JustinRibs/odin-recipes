        <li>Pure unsweetened acai puree</li>
        <li>Frozen blueberries and strawberries</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Liquid (Water or Milk)</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Granola</li>
            <li>Seeds</li>
            <li>Nuts</li>
            <li>Fresh sliced fruit</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Freeze your fruit.</b> Slice your banana and transfer it to a small baking sheet or plate lined with
            parchment paper. To the same plate, add the blueberries and strawberries (store-bought frozen fruit will
            work just as well). Transfer tray or plate to the freezer and allow the fruit to freeze completely.</li>
        <li><b>Blend</b> Once frozen, add the milk and yogurt to the bowl of a large, high-speed blender with a tamper
            (see tips and tricks). Add the frozen blueberries, strawberries, banana, and broken up acai. With the
            blender on low, use the tamper to push the frozen fruit down, mixing around as much as possible. Continue to
            blend on low until smooth, only adding additional liquid when needed.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble</b> Divide the smoothie into two bowls and top with all your favorite toppings. Best enjoyed
            immediately (because it will melt).</li>
    </ol>
