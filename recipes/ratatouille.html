    <p>Ratatouille is like many delicious dishes that have become iconic and symbolize a region. What started as peasant
        food ultimately worked its way up to being featured on restaurant menus. At that point, it became the modern
        version of the eggplant, zucchini, pepper and tomato dish we enjoy today, and many chefs get creative with riffs
        on the classic preparation, adding other vegetables or trying different preparation styles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggplant</li>
        <li>Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>Yellow Squash</li>
        <li>Zuchinni</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Bell pepper</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chopped basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).</li>
        <li>Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm) rounds, then set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the
            onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the
            crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil.
            Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula</li>
        <li>Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top
            of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and
            olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the
            vegetables are softened.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day--cover with foil and
            reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! or bon appetit as Remy would've said.</li>
